## **Projects**

1. **Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
    - **Description:** This project builds an end-to-end Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn using demographic, financial, and behavioral data.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras.
    - **Results:** I have tuned the decision threshold (0.3 instead of 0.5) to improve recall. Shifting the evaluation focus from accuracy to recall and business impact: Churn Recall is ~89%, while Accuracy is ~64%. This trade-off is intentional and appropriate for churn prediction.

2. **Spam vs Ham Classification using NLP & Naive Bayes**
    - **Description:** Building binary image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras, MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning).
    - **Results:** The final model shows balanced class-wise performance with no prediction bias toward a single class, the Test Accuracy: ~91.75%, and Test Loss: ~0.21.

2. **Image Classification using CNN with Transfer Learning (Cats vs Dogs)**
    - **Description:** Creating a text-based spam detection system that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham using classical Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, scikit-learn, naive bayes, MultinomialNB.
    - **Results:** The final model performs fairly well, with an accuracy score: ~97.00% and precision and recall for spam messages are 0.99 and 0.82.
