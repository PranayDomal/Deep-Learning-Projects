## **Projects**

1. **Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
    - **Description:** This project builds an end-to-end Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn using demographic, financial, and behavioral data.
    - **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras.
    - **Results:** I have tuned the decision threshold (0.3 instead of 0.5) to improve recall. Shifting the evaluation focus from accuracy to recall and business impact: Churn Recall is ~89%, while Accuracy is ~64%. This trade-off is intentional and appropriate for churn prediction.
